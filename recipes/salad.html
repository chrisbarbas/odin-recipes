    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my
        favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you
        can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cubed fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>2 cups strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 kiwi fruit, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 bananas, sliced</li>
        <li>2 oranges, peeled and sectioned</li>
        <li>1 cup seedless grapes</li>
        <li>2 cups blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>For the sauce: Bring orange juice, lemon juice, brown sugar, orange zest, and lemon zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Set aside to cool.</ol>
    <ol>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until
        tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally,
        about 5 minutes.
    </ol>
    <ol>For the salad: Layer fruit in a large, clear glass bowl in this order: pineapple, strawberries, kiwi fruit, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries. Pour cooled sauce over fruit; cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours before serving.</ol>
